              <p className="md:w-[40rem] text-[#3e474d] text-justify">The workshop on seed balls commences with an introduction to these eco-friendly spheres and their ecological significance, emphasizing their utility in reforestation, wildflower planting, and habitat restoration. It then shifts focus to seed selection, educating participants on the importance of choosing native plant species suitable for the local environment. The core activity centers around mixing clay, soil, and selected seeds, with instructors guiding participants on the correct ratios and consistency of the mixture. Afterward, participants form small, marble-sized seed balls, each housing one or more seeds within a protective clay-soil shell. The next step involves drying and curing the seed balls, a crucial process explained by instructors to ensure their robustness for planting. Participants are then taught various planting techniques, such as tossing them into open fields, scattering them in gardens, or strategically placing them in degraded areas, with a focus on timing and location for optimal success. Throughout the workshop, the environmental benefits of seed balls, including soil enrichment, erosion control, and biodiversity enhancement, are underscored. Participants also have the hands-on opportunity to create their own seed balls, experimenting with different seed combinations and shapes.</p>
